# Vector Stream UI

Advanced OSINT Intelligence Platform - Frontend Interface

## Overview

Vector Stream UI is the frontend interface for the Vector Streams OSINT platform, providing an intuitive web-based interface for intelligence gathering and analysis operations. The platform features a multi-page architecture with dedicated pages for different aspects of the Vector Streams ecosystem.

## Features

- **Dashboard** - Main landing page with platform overview and navigation
- **Vector Streams Explanation** - Comprehensive explanation of how vector-based intelligence processing works
- **Use Cases** - Intelligence operations, cybersecurity, blockchain analysis, and OSINT applications
- **Quantum Vector Bridge (QVB)** - Advanced quantum computing integration with IBM Qiskit
- **Sustainability** - Environmental impact and efficiency advantages of the Vector Streams architecture

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom quantum-inspired design
- **Icons**: Lucide Icons and custom emoji icons
- **Backend Integration**: RESTful API communication with Vector Streams backend
- **Quantum Computing**: IBM Qiskit integration for enhanced processing

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/KingGekko/vector-stream-ui.git
cd vector-stream-ui
```

2. Open any HTML file in your web browser or serve them using a local web server:
```bash
# Using Python
python -m http.server 8080

# Using Node.js
npx serve .

# Using PHP
php -S localhost:8080
```

3. Navigate to `dashboard.html` to start exploring the platform

4. Connect to the Vector Streams API backend (default: `http://localhost:3000`)

## Page Navigation

- **dashboard.html** - Start here for an overview of the platform
- **vector-streams.html** - Learn about the core concepts and technology
- **use-cases.html** - Explore practical applications and use cases
- **qvb.html** - Discover quantum computing integration capabilities
- **sustainability.html** - Understand environmental benefits and efficiency

## API Integration

The UI communicates with the Vector Streams API backend through RESTful endpoints:

- **OSINT Endpoints**: `/api/v1/osint/*`
- **Chat Interface**: `/api/v1/chat`
- **Vector Operations**: `/api/v1/vectors/*`
- **WebSocket**: Real-time updates and streaming data

## Key Features

### Universal API Integration
Connect to any API with just an API key - no complex integrations required.

### Real-Time Intelligence Processing
Process data as it flows through your systems with instant analysis and insights.

### Quantum Vector Bridge
Next-generation quantum computing integration for exponential processing power.

### Sustainable Architecture
Built on Rust for maximum efficiency with 90% less memory usage and 85% less energy consumption.
